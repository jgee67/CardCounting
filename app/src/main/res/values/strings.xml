    <string name="basics_b1">"•\tStrategy used for blackjack to determine the ratio of high cards vs. low cards that remain in the deck over the course of a game. </string>
    <string name="basics_b2_1">•	The running count is a value that starts at 0.</string>
    <string name="basics_b2_2">•	Each card has an assigned value that varies by card counting system. Swipe left to view the different systems.</string>
    <string name="basics_b2_3">•	All you need to do is add the value of each opened card to the running count. \nFor example:</string>
    <string name="basics_b2_4">•	The running count in the case is +1.</string>
    <string name="basics_b3_1">•	If the running count is positive, then there are more high cards than low cards, you are at an advantage again the dealer.</string>
    <string name="basics_b3_2">•	If the running count is negative then there are more low cards that high cards, the dealer has an advantage over you.</string>
    <string name="basics_b3_3">•	When the running count is +2 you should start increasing your bet. </string>
    <string name="basics_b3_4">•	When playing with multi-deck, making betting judgement using just the running count is insufficient. You need to do: \n Running Count / (# Deck Starts - #Decks Left)</string>
